## üì¶ Requirements

- R ‚â• 4.2  
- The following R packages:  
  - `shiny`  
  - `bslib`  
  - `leaflet`  
  - `leaflet.extras`  
  - `DT`  
  - `dplyr`  
  - `mime`  
  - `exiftoolr`

Additionally, the app requires [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) installed on your system, since `exiftoolr` is just an R interface to it.
